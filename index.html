	<p1> This is where I will be uploading all of my assignments for my web production class.
    I'm Jennifer Fletcher, a senior majoring in Media Studies. I've always loved creating anything
    I could. Whether it be physical or digital, I love exploring every creative avenue I can. I'm
    really enthusiastic about investigating the influence media as a whole has on our day to day
    lives and learning how to utilize different forms of media to influence others. We all spend
    a lot of our lives consuming media through online videos, films/television shows, scrolling on
    various social platforms, ads all around us-- I find it fascinating to study both the effect it
    has on us, but also how to create it as well. I was involved with filming at Manhattan
    Neighborhood Network, and it really peaked my interest in this field. I also interned with the Socially
    Relevant Film Fesitival as the Submissions and Digital Media Coordinator which also furthered my interests.

   <h3> While you're here, enjoy the calming sounds of the Breath of the Wild soundtrack! </h3>

  <p> Add to the experience by layering this audio of rain sounds over the soundtrack! You might need to adjust the volume, but
    it's worth it.
