		<b> What constitutes a creative web project today?</b> <br>
		A web project can be anything that anyone wants it to be. There aren't specific structures or rules dictating what is and isn't a creative project for the web. There are increasingly more and more ways to utlitize websites to create innovative content that engages an audience. My personal favorites are the ones that demonstrate how large the solar system is because it blows my mind. <br> <br>

		<b> How do each of you wish to employ the web or the internet as a creative platform?</b> <br>

		One of my goals with the web is less about making creative web content, but creating a portfolio platform for myself to showcase my creative projects. Think like- a professional blog for job application type of stuff to create my own brand. <br> <br>

		<b> What are your goals in this course? </b> <br>

		My goals in the class is to gain basic front end web development skills to boost my chances of being hired in the media industry by having the most possible transferable skills.
